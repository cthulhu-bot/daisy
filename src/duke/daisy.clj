   - Keeps track of component state, and will not start an
     already-started component.

   - Also provides a function to pretty-print a system map."

(defmacro defcomponent
  "Macro to define a component.

  Expands into a defrecord and a factory function.

  The record implements com.stuartsierra.component/Lifecycle such that
  the start and stop methods call daisy/start and daisy/stop.

  Parameters are:
  `type-name` - symbol, the name of the record
  `doc` - a docstring
  `opts` - map - keys can include:
      :init-args - vector of symbols. Becomes the argument list of the factory fn.
      :injected - vector of symbols. Defines the components that this component
                  depends on, and expects to have injected before it starts.
      :creates - vector of symbols. Defines fields that this component will set
                 values for in its start method.
      :factory-name - symbol. Specifies a name for the factory fn. If not set, the
                      name will be generated as \"new-\" + (camel->lisp type-name)
  `start` and `stop` - method bodies for the lifecycle start and stop methods.
  `body` - anything here will be added to the body of the defrecord. You can use
           this to implement other protocols.

  Example:

  (defcomponent Foo
    \"This is a sweet component\"
    {:init-args [blah]
     :injected  [bar]
     :creates   [foo]}
    (start [this] (assoc this :foo (flarp blah bar)))
    (stop  [this] (unflarp! foo) (assoc this :foo nil))
    IFunky
    (funky [this] (funkify foo bar blah)))
  "
  [type-name doc {:keys [init-args injected creates factory-name]} start stop & body]
  {:pre [(symbol? type-name)
         (= 'start (first start))]}
  (let [fields  (vec (concat init-args injected creates))
        fn-name (or factory-name (str "new-" (camel->lisp (name type-name))))
        start   (cons '-start (rest start))
        stop    (cons '-stop  (rest stop))]
